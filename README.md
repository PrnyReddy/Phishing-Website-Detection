The phishing website detection system provides a robust security mechanism for detecting and preventing phishing domains from reaching users. Using Machine Learning, this project presents a simple and portable approach to detecting spoofed webpages and resolving security vulnerabilities. Because all of the major tasks are performed in the backend, it can be easily operated by anyone. The user must enter the URL into the GUI and then click the submit button. The output is "YES" for phishing URLs and "NO" for non-phishing URLs.

DEPENDENCIES FOR PYTHON:


• NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn: Data cleaning, analysis, and modelling.

• Pickle: Used to export the model to a local machine.

• Tkinter, Pyqt, and QtDesigner: For creating the software's Graphical User Interface (GUI).
 
Install Anaconda from www.anaconda.com to avoid the hassle of installing independent Python packages and libraries. It is a Python data science platform that includes all of the ML libraries, data analysis libraries, Jupyter Notebooks, Spyder, and other features that make it simple to use and efficient.. 


The following steps must be taken in order to run the software code:
	
	• Add anaconda to the system.
	• gui.py: This file contains the GUI code and is linked to other software modules.
	• Feature extractor.py: This file contains the code for data analysis and modelling.
	• Rf model.py: This file contains the machine learning model that has been trained.
	• Only gui.py should be run to run the entire software, and the rest of the modules should be kept in the same folder.
